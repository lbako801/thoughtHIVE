# thoughtHIVE üêù
thoughtHive is a social network web application API where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create friend lists. The API is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition, the API uses the Luxon date library to format timestamps.

# Getting Started
To get started with the ThoughtHive API, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the official website, and MongoDB from the MongoDB website or through a package manager such as Homebrew.  
Once you have Node.js and MongoDB installed, you can follow these steps to run the API locally:  
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
  2. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
  3. Create a new .env file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:  

    MONGODB_URI=<your MongoDB connection string>
    JWT_SECRET=<your secret key for JSON Web Tokens>

  4. Run ```npm start``` to start the server. By default, the API will be hosted on ```http://localhost:3001```.
